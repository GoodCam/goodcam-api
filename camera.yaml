  version: '1.9.0'
  description: |
    GoodCam devices provide a REST API, RTSP server and they are also able to
    advertise themselves in a local network environment using mDNS and DNS-SD.

    # Authentication

    Most of the HTTP endpoints require authentication via
    [HTTP Digest](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7616). The same authentication
    is also required by the RTSP server. It is possible to choose between MD5
    and SHA-256 digest when the application is being configured for the first
    time. It is not possible to switch between MD5 and SHA-256 later without
    factory reset because the HTTP Digest standard itself does not provide any
    means for digest algorithm negotiation. The only alternative solution would
    be providing `WWW-Authenticate` challenges with all supported algorithms.
    Such solution would not make much sense from the security point of view
    because any potential attacker could simply choose the weakest digest
    algorithm available.

    The MD5 digest should be considered deprecated and its use should be
    avoided. It's supported only for backwards compatibility with
    [RFC 2617](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2617) (the former definition of
    HTTP Digest). Unfortunately, even modern web browsers currently don't
    support other HTTP Digest algorithms than MD5, so in cases when the API is
    being consumed by a web browser, it is possible to use the MD5 algorithm or
    it is also possible to use an alternative HTTP client supporting the more
    recent version of HTTP Digest. The latter option should be preferred if
    possible.

    Some web browsers also do not support HTTP Digest for WebSocket, which is
    being used for WebRTC signaling. In order to overcome this issue, it is
    possible to generate access tokens which can be used as a query parameter.
    Whenever there is a valid access token within query string of a request URL
    (query parameter `x-goodcam-devicetoken`), HTTP Digest authentication will
    be skipped.

    # Security considerations

    Currently, there is no TLS or other forms of encryption being used. The
    REST API is available only via plain HTTP. The reasoning behind is simple.
    Using TLS in a local network environment is impractical. There are
    basically only two options for using TLS in such environments:

    1. Registering a domain name that's globally unique (e.g. xyz.com) and
       buying a proper TLS certificate from a CA (or using Let's Encrypt). All
       devices in the local network would then have to use a local DNS server
       which would be resolving the hostname to a local IP address. Note that
       there is no CA that would issue a TLS certificate for a hostname that
       cannot be verified as globally unique. Doing so would be a serious
       security risk.
    2. Using a self-signed certificate (either directly or as a custom CA) and
       distributing it to all client devices within the local network. All the
       client devices would still have to use a hostname to access the API.

    Either of these options are rarely used because it isn't easy to set
    everything up without certain technical skills and it may also include some
    additional costs. Right now there is no other widely-used option for HTTP
    encryption within local networks.

    **Because of this, the application services (both HTTP and RTSP) should not
    be exposed to the Internet or other outside networks.**

    TLS support might be implemented in the future for the REST API to make
    exposing the API publicly possible, however, the RTSP protocol does not
    support TLS, so exposing it would still be a serious security risk. If
    needed, the remote access functionality should be implemented using
    [GoodCam Cloud](https://goodcam.github.io/goodcam-api/cloud.html) and
    WebRTC.

    # Service discovery

    GoodCam devices advertise themselves using
    [mDNS](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6762) and
    [DNS-SD](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6763). The service name is
    `_goodcam._tcp.local`, so all you need to do to find a GoodCam device in a
    local network is to send an mDNS query asking for `PTR` records named
    `_goodcam._tcp.local`. Doing so will yield instance names of all GoodCam
    devices within the local network. These instance names can be used then to
    retrieve `SRV` and `TXT` records of those instances. The `SRV` records will
    then contain the device hostnames and ports where the REST API can be
    accessed. The `TXT` records will contain the API version and the root for
    the REST API endpoints. The API root is `/api/` by default. And, of course,
    the device IP addresses can be retrieved by querying the `A` or `AAAA`
    records.

    ## Example
    ```text
    -> mDNS query (QCLASS, QTYPE, QNAME):
        ANY PTR _goodcam._tcp.local

    <- mDNS response (RR TYPE, RR DATA):
        PTR My\ Camera._goodcam._tcp.local
        PTR GoodCam._goodcam._tcp.local
        PTR GoodCam\ #11._goodcam._tcp.local

    -> mDNS query (QCLASS, QTYPE, QNAME):
        ANY SRV My\ Camera._goodcam._tcp.local

    <- mDNS response (RR TYPE, RR DATA):
        SRV 0 0 80 GC12345678ABCD.local

    -> mDNS query (QCLASS, QTYPE, QNAME):
        ANY TXT My\ Camera._goodcam._tcp.local

    <- mDNS response (RR TYPE, RR DATA):
        TXT root=/ version=1

    -> mDNS query (QCLASS, QTYPE, QNAME):
        ANY A GC12345678ABCD.local

    <- mDNS response (RR TYPE, RR DATA):
        A 192.168.123.123
    ```

    # Initial setup

    When a GoodCam device hasn't been set up before (or after factory reset),
    all API endpoints will be redirecting to `/v1/users/` indicating that there
    are no user accounts and the initial setup should be performed.

    The setup itself is simple. The API client is only required to create the
    first user account (see
    [Creating a new user account](#operation/create-user)).

    # WiFi cameras

    All wifi cameras are in the AP mode by default. Their SSID is concatenation
    of "goodcam-" prefix and the corresponding MAC address without colons, e.g.
    "goodcam-112233445566". The prefix is hardcoded into the firmware and it
    can be changed upon request. The camera should be connected to an existing
    WiFi network as a part of the initial setup (see the example below).

    # Example: accessing an Ethernet camera in a mobile app

    1. Look up all `_goodcam._tcp.local` services using service discovery.
    2. List all instance names in the user interface, e.g.:
       * My Camera
       * GoodCam
       * GoodCam #11
    3. Allow entering a camera IP address manually (useful in cases when the
       service discovery does not work for some reason).
    4. After the user taps on a camera, perform the initial setup (if needed)
       and log in to the camera (ask the user for credentials).
    5. After successful login, allow changing camera settings, displaying video
       streams, taking snapshots, etc.

    # Example: accessing a WiFi camera in a mobile app

    1. Look up all WiFi Access Points with the "goodcam-" prefix (or your
       custom prefix) and list them in the user interface.
    2. After the user taps on a camera, connect to the corresponding Access
       Point.
    3. Look up all `_goodcam._tcp.local` services using service discovery.
       (Note: There will be only one.)
    4. Perform the initial setup (i.e. create the admin user) and log in to the
       camera.
    5. List available WiFi networks and let user pick one.
    6. Connect the camera to the selected network (i.e. update the camera
       network settings).
    7. Reboot the camera.
    8. Connect the mobile device to the same WiFi network and wait until the
       camera becomes available.

    description: |
      The privacy mask allows hiding arbitrary regions in the resulting
      video. The regions can be specified using a list of triangle
      coordinates. More complex shapes can be composed of multiple triangles
      if needed. The triangle coordinates are expected to be decimal numbers
      from the interval `[0; 1]` where the point `[0; 0]` represents the top
      left corner of the video and `[1; 1]` represents the bottom right
      corner of the video.

      Each triangle is represented by a list of 6 decimal numbers
      representing coordinates of the three corresponding triangle vertices.
      For example:

      ```json
      [0.1, 0.1, 0.2, 0.2, 0.3, 0.1]
      ```

      represents a triangle with the following `[x, y]` vertices:

      ```text

      This section describes configuration of audio/video streams as well as
      protocols for retrieving the streams.

      Currently there is a support for MJPEG and H.264 video and G.711 and PCM
      audio. Other codecs may be added in the future. Not all devices support
      all of the codecs. You can get a list of supported codecs using the API
      endpoint for [getting stream limits](#operation/get-stream-limits).

      Keep in mind that some encodings are not supported in certain media
      containers or streaming protocols. This matrix shows which codecs are
      supported where:

      |      | MJPEG | H.264 | G.711 | PCM |
      | ---- |:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:---:|
      | **RTSP** | | &#x25CF; | &#x25CF; | &#x25CF; |
      | **WebRTC**<sup>1</sup> | | &#x25CF; | &#x25CF; | &#x25CF; |
      | **Fragmented MP4 over HTTP** | | &#x25CF; | &#x25CF; | |
      | **MJPEG over HTTP** | &#x25CF; | | | |

  - name: motion-detection
    x-displayName: Motion detection
    description: |
      The motion detection engine, if enabled, continuously evaluates video
      frames with constant rate of 5 evaluations per second. The API can be
      used to configure the motion detection engine and to retrieve motion
      detection metadata or to send motion detection events.

      The motion detection metadata can be retrieved using WebSocket as a
      continuous stream of JSON objects, each describing a single evaluation
      (see [Getting motion detection metadata stream](#operation/motion-detection-stream) for more info).

      The motion detection engine recognizes internally two states for every
      configured hook:
      * idle
      * alert

      By default, each hook is in the _idle_ state. If there is a motion, the
      hook immediately transitions to the _alert_ state. If there is no
      motion for at least a given amount of time (this can be configured using
      the `reset_delay` parameter), the hook transitions back to the _idle_
      state.

      Whenever a hook transitions to the _alert_ state, a new motion detection
      event is generated (unless delayed using the `trigger_delay` parameter).
      The event is then sent to the hook target (see below). In situations when
      the hook would stay in the _alert_ state for a long time, follow-up
      events can be generated. The delay until the next follow-up event can be
      configured using the `resend_delay` parameter.

      ### For webhooks

      If the configured HTTP method is POST and the request body isn't
      specified, the default body will be a JSON object containing the
      following properties:

      * `alert_id` - Sequential ID of the motion detection alert. The ID is
        incremented on each transition of the hook from the _idle_ state to the
        _alert_ state. The ID will be reset to zero on each restart of the
        motion detection engine. This includes camera reboots and changes of
        the motion detection settings.
      * `event_id` - Sequential ID indicating how many events with this alert
        ID have been already generated. The first event will have its event
        ID set to zero. Each follow-up event (if configured) will then have
        the event ID greater than zero.
      * `regions` - The most recent list of image regions where motion was
        detected (see [Getting motion detection metadata stream](#operation/motion-detection-stream) for more info).
  - name: cloud
    x-displayName: Cloud client
    description: |
      The cloud client works as a gateway for remote access to the camera. The
      client is responsible for maintaining a permanent connection with a cloud
      service. The connection itself is done using HTTP upgrade and
      documentation of the corresponding protocol is available
      <a href="https://github.com/GoodCam/goodcam-api/tree/master/docs/cloud-server.md" target="_blank">here</a>.
      The cloud client supports both HTTP and HTTPS, so it is possible (and
      preferable) to secure the connection using TLS.

      ### Connecting a camera to GoodCam Cloud

      In principle, the camera can connect to any cloud service implementing
      the underlying protocol, however, the pairing process may be different
      with third party cloud providers, so we will focus only on the GoodCam
      Cloud service here.

      In order to set up your camera for remote access, you will need to:

      1. Perform the initial setup (if needed; see [Initial setup](#section/Initial-setup)).
      2. Enable the cloud client (see [Changing cloud client settings](#operation/update-cloud-client-settings)).
      3. Get the camera device ID (see [Getting information about the cloud client](#operation/get-cloud-client-info)).
      4. Initiate pairing for the device ID (see the <a href="cloud.html" target="_blank">GoodCam Cloud API documentation</a>).
      5. Connect the camera to the cloud (see [Connecting to the cloud service](#operation/connect-to-cloud)).

      Once paired, the camera will maintain a permanent connection with the
      cloud service and it will be available for remote access via the GoodCam
      Cloud API. The camera can be paired with only one GoodCam Cloud account
      at a time and only this user will be able to access the camera remotely.

      _Note: The cloud service URL should be set to
      `https://proxy.goodcam.io:8888` in order to connect to the GoodCam Cloud
      service. Different URLs may be used in order to connect the camera to
      another cloud service provider._

      description: |
        **Please note that firmware update is a delicate procedure. The device
        power must not be interrupted during the firmware update. Doing so can
        damage the device irreversibly.**

        The firmware update may also factory reset the device depending on the
        firmware version. The device will be reset into factory defaults if the
        current version of the firmware and the new version of the firmware are
        considered incompatible. The firmware (in)compatibility is determined
        using these semantic versioning rules:
        * `0.a.b` -> `0.a.c` where `c >= b` is considered a compatible update,
        * `a.b.c` -> `a.d.e` where `a > 0` and `d >= b` is considered a
          compatible update regardless of the relation between `c` and `e`,
        * all other updates are considered incompatible and will trigger device
          factory reset.

        For example:
        * `0.2.1` -> `0.1.0` - incompatible
        * `0.2.1` -> `0.2.0` - incompatible
        * `0.2.1` -> `0.2.1` - compatible
        * `0.2.1` -> `0.2.2` - compatible
        * `0.2.1` -> `0.3.0` - incompatible
        * `2.2.2` -> `1.0.0` - incompatible
        * `2.2.2` -> `2.1.0` - incompatible
        * `2.2.2` -> `2.2.1` - compatible
        * `2.2.2` -> `2.2.2` - compatible
        * `2.2.2` -> `2.2.3` - compatible
        * `2.2.2` -> `2.3.0` - compatible

        When changing the network interface mode, all fields required for the
        particular mode must be present in the request. Otherwise, only the
        fields being changed need to be present. The `mac_address` field can be
        set to force using a given MAC address. Setting the field to `null`
        will reset the interface to its original MAC address.

        The device needs to be rebooted for the changes to take effect.

        **Fields required for the `static` mode:**
        * `ipv4_address`
        * `ipv4_mask`

        **Fields required for the `dhcp` mode:**
        * `dns_from_dhcp`

        WiFi interfaces also accept the `wifi` field expecting a WiFi settings.
        A WiFi interface can be configured as a client or an access point. All
        WiFi interfaces are in the access point mode by default. When in the
        access point mode, the interface will always use a static IP address
        (even if configured as a DHCP client) and the access point SSID will be
        automatically configured to a concatenation of the "goodcam-" prefix
        (or any other prefix built into the firmware) and MAC address of the
        network interface (12 hex characters without colons).

        The WiFi client configuration must also include an SSID of the network
        where the device should connect to. The `passowrd` parameter is
        optional because not all WiFi networks are necessarily
        password-protected.

        It is an entrypoint for a WebSocket based stream of motion detection
        metadata. The protocol is trivial. After the WebSocket handshake, the
        server will send motion detection metadata as a JSON object each 200
        ms.

        The metadata objects will have the following properties:
        * `regions` - a list of objects describing regions with detected motion

        Each region object will have the following properties:
        * `top` - relative position of the top edge (a value between 0 and 1)
        * `right` - relative position of the right edge (a value between 0 and 1)
        * `bottom` - relative position of the bottom edge (a value between 0 and 1)
        * `left` - relative position of the left edge (a value between 0 and 1)

        The usual behavior of the VBR mode is that the encoder targets the
        maximum possible quality from a given range which fits a given maximum
        bitrate. Therefore, the video bitrate will drop below the given maximum
        only if the maximum quality has been already reached. The maximum
        quality can be also interpreted as the desired target quality. It is
        also possible for the maximum bitrate to be be exceeded if the quality
        would drop below a given minimum.

        The exact meaning of the quality is codec-dependent. For example, in
        case of h264, the 0-100 scale of quality is translated to the Quantizer
        Parameter (0 quality is translated as QP 51, 100 quality is translated
        as QP 0).

                It is essentially the interval between IDR frames (key-frames).
                The unit is the number of frames. It's recommended to keep the
                interval between 1 and 6 seconds for live streams, so for
                example if the FPS is 25, the GoP size should be between 25 and
                150. Setting the value too low will increase bandwidth
                requirements, whereas setting it too high will increase the
                mean time before the stream playback can start and it can also
                cause problems when streaming using HLS or fragmented MP4.
