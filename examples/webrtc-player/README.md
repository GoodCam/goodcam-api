# WebRTC player

This is an example of a WebRTC video player for GoodCam cameras. See
`example.html` and contents of the `js` folder for the full implementation.

Please note that you need to set the video codec of your camera stream to h264.
MJPEG is not supported by WebRTC. Depending on the web browser, you may also
need to change the codec settings. See the table below for more information.

| Platform | Browser | Supported codecs | Supported h264 profiles | Notes |
| -------- | ------- | ---------------- | ----------------------- | ----- |
| Android | Chrome | h264 | baseline, main, high | |
| Android | Firefox | - | | see Note 1 |
| iOS | Chrome | - | | see Note 2 |
| iOS | Safari | - | | see Note 2 |
| Linux | Chrome | h264 | baseline, main | |
| Linux | Edge | ? | | |
| Linux | Firefox | - | | see Note 1 |
| OS X | Chrome | h264 | baseline, main, high | |
| OS X | Edge | h264 | baseline, main, high | |
| OS X | Firefox | - | | see Note 1 |
| OS X | Safari | - | | see Note 2 |
| Windows | Chrome | h264 | baseline, main | |
| Windows | Edge | h264 | baseline, main | |
| Windows | Firefox | - | | see Note 1 |

_Note 1: Firefox currently isn't supported because it rejects WebRTC offers
generated by the camera. Even though it supports the h264 codec, it rejects
WebRTC offers that do not offer video streams in other codecs required by the
WebRTC specification. GoodCam cameras cannot offer video streams in the other
codecs required by WebRTC because these codecs are not supported by the camera
HW. We are currently investigating possible solutions to this issue._

_Note 2: Safari has a similar problem as Firefox. Chrome on iOS is de facto
Safari, so the issue is there as well._
