# GoodCam API

GoodCam devices provide a REST API, RTSP server and they are also able to
advertise themselves in a local network environment using mDNS and DNS-SD.

See our [API documentation](https://goodcam.github.io/goodcam-api/) for more
information.

It is also possible to access your devices remotely via GoodCam Cloud. See the
[GoodCam Cloud API documentation](https://goodcam.github.io/goodcam-api/cloud.html)
for more details.
